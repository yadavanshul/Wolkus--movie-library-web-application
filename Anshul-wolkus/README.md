1. The application must have user authentication ( Sign In/ Sign Up )
2. After logging in users will be navigated to the home screen where they should see a search option where they can search movies and see details of those movies. 
3. They can create a list of movies by adding the movies to lists. ( Similar to youtube playlists ). On the home page, different movie lists created by that user will be displayed.

5. You can use OMDB API for the movie search option.
6. The Search & List page should have a nice layout, take inspiration from other websites/applications.
